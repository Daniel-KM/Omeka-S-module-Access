Access Resource (module for Omeka S)
====================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Access Resource] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to protect files to be
accessed from the anonymous visitors, but nevertheless available globally or on
requests by guests users, reserved to list of ips, or available by a token. The
metadata of the restricted resources are always available to let the visitors
know that they exist. The file itself is replaced by a fake file.


Installation
------------

### Associated modules

If the access is reserved by ip or by token, the module can be used standalone.
If the access is reserved globally, the module will need to identify users,
generally with the module [Guest] or [Guest Role]. If the access is restricted
individually, the module [Guest] will be needed to manage the requests. The
public part can be managed easily via the module [Blocks Disposition], or
directly in the theme.

### Incompatibility

This module is currently incompatible with module [Group], that manages rights
by a list of group.

### Copy of the module

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

* From the zip

Download the last release [AccessResource.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `AccessResource`.

### Configuration of the web server

Omeka does not manage the requests of the files of the web server (generally
Apache or Nginx): they are directly served by it, without any control. To
protect them, you have to tell the web server to redirect the users requests to
Omeka, so it can check the rights, before returning the file or a forbidden
response. You can adapt `routes.ini` as you wish too.

#### Apache

The Apache file ".htaccess" at the root of Omeka should be updated to avoid
direct access to files and to redirect urls to the module.

For that, you have to adapt the following code to your needs in the main [.htaccess]
at the root of Omeka, in a `.htaccess` file in the `files` directory, or
directly in the config of the virtual host of the server (quicker). The example
below is written for the Omeka [.htaccess] file. If you prefer to use other
files, adapt the paths.

In this example, all original and large files will be protected: a check will be
done by the module before delivering files. If the user has no access to a file,
a fake file is displayed.

The small derivatives files (square and thumbnails), can be protected too, but
it is generally useless. Anyway, it depends on the original images.

##### When Omeka S is installed at the root of a domain

Insert the following lines at line 4 of [.htaccess], just after `RewriteEngine On`:

```Apache
RewriteRule ^files/original/(.*)$ /access/files/original/$1 [P]
RewriteRule ^files/large/(.*)$ /access/files/large/$1 [P]
# Uncomment the lines below to protect square and medium thumbnails too, if really needed.
#RewriteRule ^files/medium/(.*)$ /access/files/medium/$1 [P]
#RewriteRule ^files/square/(.*)$ /access/files/square/$1 [P]
```

##### When Omeka S is installed in a sub-path (https://example.com/digital-library/)

Insert the following lines at line 4 of [.htaccess], just after `RewriteEngine On`,
adapting it to your real config (here, the sub-path is `digital-library`):

```Apache
RewriteRule ^files/original/(.*)$ /digital-library/access/files/original/$1 [P]
RewriteRule ^files/large/(.*)$ /digital-library/access/files/large/$1 [P]
# Uncomment the lines below to protect square and medium thumbnails too, if really needed.
#RewriteRule ^files/medium/(.*)$ /digital-library/access/files/medium/$1 [P]
#RewriteRule ^files/square/(.*)$ /digital-library/access/files/square/$1 [P]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$1 ^(/.+)/(.*)::/digital-library/access/\2$
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=BASE:%1]
```

##### Common issues

- Enable to redirect to a virtual proxy with https

  The config uses flag `[P]` for an internal fake `Proxy`, so Apache rewrites
  the path like a proxy. So if there is a redirection to a secured server
  (https), the certificate should be running and up-to-date and the option
  `SSLProxyEngine on` should be set in the Apache config of the web server.
  Anyway, if you have access to it, you can include all rules inside it
  directly (`ProxyPass`). If you don't have access to the Apache config, just
  use the full unsecure url with `http://` for the internal proxy. Because it is
  a fake proxy, it doesn't matter if the internal redirect url is unsecure:

  ```Apache
  RewriteRule ^files/original/(.*)$ http://example.org/digital-library/access/files/original/$1 [P]
  RewriteRule ^files/large/(.*)$ http://example.org/digital-library/access/files/large/$1 [P]
  ```

#### Nginx

The configuration of Apache above should be adapted for Nginx.


Usage
-----

Omeka has two modes of visibility: public or private. This module adds a third
mode for the medias, restricted. When enabled, the metadata of the restricted
private medias are viewable, but not the original files (and eventually the
large and other derivatives files).

### Access mode

The rights to see the files are controlled on the fly. The restricted visibility
can be managed in three ways:

- `global`: all authenticated users have access to all the restricted files. In
  practice, the guest users have no access to private resources, but they can
  view all private resources that are marked restricted.
- `ip`: all visitors with a specific ip, for example the ip of the physical
  library or the one of a researcher, can have access to all the restricted
  files.
- `individual`: each file should be made accessible by a specific user one by
  one. So the module has some forms to manage individual requests and accesses.
  This mode requires the admin to set each right of each resource. This mode can
  be combined with a list of ips to allow visitors with these ips to access to
  any files, as above.

The default mode is `global`. To set the mode `ip` or `individual`, you should
specify it in the file `config/local.config.php` of the Omeka directory:

```php
    'accessresource' => [
        'access_mode' => 'individual',
    ],
```

### Identification of the restricted medias

After the configuration, you should identify all medias that you want to make
available via a restricted access. By default, private resources remain private,
so you need to allow visitors to know that they exist. That is to say you can
keep some private resources private, and some other ones available on request,
or globally.

To indicate which resources are restricted, simply add a value to the property
`curation:reservedAccess`, that is created by the module. When a private
resource has a value for this property, whatever it is (except empty value `0`),
it becomes available for all guest users, and all visitors can view its metadata
automatically too in listings. Preview will be available for media too. The
value of this property can be private or public.

Important: public medias are never restricted, so you need to set them private.
Note that a public item can have a private media and vice-versa. So, most of the
time, the value should be set in the metadata of the media. The value can be
specified for the item too to simplify management.

### Management of requests

If you choose modes `global` or `ip`, there is nothing to do more. Once users
are authenticated as guest or by ip, they will be able to see the files.

In the case of the individual mode, there are two ways to process.

- The admin can made some medias available directly in the menu "Access Resource"
  in the sidebar. Simply add a new access, select a resource and a user, and he
  will be able to view it. A token is created too: it allows visitors without
  guest account to see the resource.

- The guest user can request an access to a resource they want. It can be done
  directly via a button, for logged users, or via a contact form for the
  anonymous people. The contact form may be added by the module [Contact Us].
  After the request, the admin will receive an email, and he can accept or
  reject the request.

There are forms in a tab for each media and in the left sidebar.

The module allows another access mode, by token. This mode is available only in
the "individual" mode currently. You can find them on access view/edit page.

In public front-end, a dashboard is added for guest users. The link is available
in the guest user board (`/s/my-site/guest/access-resource`).


TODO
----

- [ ] Make resources available by token in global mode.
- [ ] Make resources available by token only, not login (like module Contribute).
- [x] Make non-exclusive mode "ip" and "individual".
- [ ] Fix ip check for ipv6.
- [ ] Use Omeka Store instead of local file system.
- [ ] Manage ip by item set or by user instead of sites?


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
